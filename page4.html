        <h1>4 Underrated destinations you must have on your travel list.</h1>
        <h5>Ms. Hiba Fatima | Nov 11,2021 | 100 comments | 15 min read</h5>    

    </div>
    
    <div id="div1">
        <p>As a travel blogger for 10 years now, I'm well aware that most people gravitate towards certain popular
            destinations such as Thailand in Asia or Pakistan in South Asia. But... what if you want to go somewhere a
            bit more original? Somewhere that not everyone already has on their bucket list?<br>I actually find it so
            much fun going to destinations that are a little less known. So, let me highlight here some of my favorite
            underrated destinations that are still often overlooked by the masses....
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="div1">
        <h3>1. Astore Valley</h3>
        <img src="images/Astore-Valley.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Astore is a very under-the-radar place to visit in Pakistan for a few reasons: its roads aren't in great
            condition, there aren't as many hotels, and cell phone service is virtually non-existent. </p>
    </div>

    <div id="div1">
        <h3>2. Peshawar</h3>
        <img src="images/Peshawar.jpg" alt="">
        <p>While Peshawar is a widely-known city, it's extremely underrated and often skipped by both foreign and
            domestic tourists alike. Yes, it might be extremely conservative, but the city is truly home to some of the
            kindest people in all of Pakistan- and trust me, that's saying something. <br><br> Peshawar might seem like
            just another bustling metropolis at first glance, but a quick walk through its Old City will leave you
            amazed. The “City of Flowers” as it is known, is the oldest in all of Pakistan and its rich history can be
            felt at each and every turn. Stunning wooden havelis dating back centuries, along with beautiful old shrines
            and mosques will transport you back in time as you wander through this special piece of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,
            formerly known as the Northwest Frontier <br><br>For history lovers and foodies alike, Peshawar is
            undoubtedly one of the best under-rated places to visit in all of Pakistan. Its culture is completely
            different from other Pakistani cities, and so is its signature tea, kahwa: you definitely won't be able to
            leave the city without having a few too many cups. </p>
    </div>

    <div id="div1">
        <h3>3. Misgar</h3>
        <img src="images/Misgar.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Perhaps the most under-the-radar place to visit in Pakistan on this list, Misgar is the last valley before
            the Chinese border, and due to how difficult it is to reach, it's almost completely ignored by any and all
            tourists. This means that you'll likely get to enjoy the epic views and meet hospitable locals all by
            yourself. <br><br>Yes, it's remote, but Misgar isn't *that* hard to reach as far as places to visit in
            Pakistan are concerned. The valley, where some locals even look slightly Chinese, is about a 5-6 hour drive
            from Gilgit CIty, which is the capital of Gilgit-Baltistan. </p>
    </div>

    <div id="div1">
        <h3>4. Multan</h3>
        <img src="images/Multan.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Despite being filled with history, Multan tends to be an underrated place to visit in Pakistan when compared
            to the country's other cities like Lahore, Karachi or Islamabad. <br><br>The tomb of Shah Rukn e Alam-a
            prominent Sufi saint who died in 1335- is perhaps the most famous of all its incredible Mughal-era design
            showcases a dome top that is said to be the second-largest in the world. A second famous tomb in the city is
            that of Baha ud-din Zakariya, yet another famous Sufi saint and poet whose teachings were revered across the
            subcontinent. <br><br> Aside from its rich history, Multan is also well known for a delicious sweet that has
            been produced in the city since Mughal times. Sohan halwa as its called is a sweet confection mixed with
            nuts that can be enjoyed at the Hafiz Halwa shop in the city. </p>
